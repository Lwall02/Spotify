# The Black Key's Spotify Metadata

## Overview
This repo shows an example of simple application of the Spotify API. Instead of in depth analysis on Spotify metadata on The Black Keys, I write a short three paragraphs on my knowledge and appreciation of The Black Keys. It is then followed by an introduction to the data retrieved through Spotify's API as well as a display of three figures made using this data. It is a showcase of one of my favorite bands coupled with a simple example of the power and ease of using Spotify's API.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains only the cleaned and filtered data since the raw data is not mine to share. The raw data was retrived through the API and a personal clinet ID and is therefore not published in this repo.
-   `other` contains relevant details about LLM chat interactions
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to download and clean the data

## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT. It was used to get some ideas of figures to create but mainly to help figure out to solutions to the error code I was receiving. This is accessible in other -> LLM-usage.txt.
